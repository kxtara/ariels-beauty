## Overview

This app consists of various technologies such as React, Tailwind CSS, and many more. The application primarily features two main functionalities: booking and payment. [Click here for a deeper insight into the process](./ariels-beauty-app/src/assets/stuff/process.md)

## My process

My process began with the creation of a wireframe followed by a high-fidelity mock-up using Figma. Subsequently, I sought advice to refine my design before strategizing the selection of tools for the project. I opted for React with Vite and Tailwind CSS. Following this, I meticulously planned the components that should be separate entities, such as the header and footer.
