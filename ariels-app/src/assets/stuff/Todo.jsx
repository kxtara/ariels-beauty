// TODO -  Research payment library (stripe)

/* TODO -  

â€¢ Work on excluding times on calendar after a user clicks pay (most likely exclude time after user pays - disable while user is on payment page, if user doesn't pay after a certain time enable time)

- We're going to try using firebase since we've already used it in this project.

- We'll store excluded times in firebase, that time being the time the current user click.

- Have to figure out how the calendar for other users will be updated when a user selects a time
